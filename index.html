        Hello, I am the Electrical Engineer.
      </p><p>
        I am extremely interested in gaining experience in the field of Engineering. The classes I have pursued for my undergraduate degree, such as, Math, Physics, Computer Science, Electron, and Computer Information System have given me a solid academic foundation in this area.
      </p><p>
        From my past internship and work experience provide me with the opportunity to apply this knowledge in the field of Engineering, as well as develop the communication, problem solving, and numeracy skills I have acquired.
      </p><p>
        I am looking to become an engineer role that will challenge me and allow me to be the best I can while I help the people around me being their best.
      </p><p>
        I love my profession. I love being an engineer, talking about engines, machines, going to site project and learn new experience.
      </p>
